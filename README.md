# Bitminers 2 Extras
Bitminers 2 Extras adds a bunch of new stuff to bitminers including solar power and remote bitminer access!
Bitminers 2 Extras is a DLC for Bitminers 2 that opens up the possibilities for how users want to design there bitcoin mining systems. You can find a list of features below.

## Features
* New larger fuel container (1000 fuel)
* New solar power system
* New solar converter to convert solar energy to AC power
* New solar panels that collect sunlight and convert it to power
* New cables (solar cables and fuel line cables)
* New extra fuel tank that can be connected to generators to give them larger fuel reserves
* New remote Bitminer upgrade
* New phone to access Bitminer terminals remotely so you don't have to go to your base.
* Completely custom models
* Completely custom sounds
* No set up required

## Solar Panels
Solar panels need direct line of sight with the skybox to produce any output (Configurable). Solar panels once exposed to the skybox will output 100W DC power. You need to use a solar converter to convert this power into useful power. Solar panels are connected using solar cables (see below).

## Remote Bitminers
This allows all bitminers to install a remote module. The module allows them to access the terminal from anywhere across the map. Theifs can also uninstall this module to prevent the owners from accessing it or can reinstall there own to take over remote control.  All bitminers "remote name" can be changed so it shows differently on the phone otherwise they will be assigned an IP by default.

## Solar Converter
The solar converter acts kind of like a generator except instead of feeding it fuel, you feed it solar power! A solar converter has 10 solar cable inputs and 2 standard plug outputs. This converts the energy generated by solar panels into usable energy for the bitminers.

## Fuel Tank
The fuel tank is a large container that can store 5000 fuel (configurable) and can be connected using a fuel line directly to the top of generators. It feeds them a constant supply of fuel until it runs out. Shooting these while there is fuel inside will cause an explosion.

## Large Fuel
Large fuel gives the user a large fuel container. This makes it much easier to fill up larger fuel tanks.
